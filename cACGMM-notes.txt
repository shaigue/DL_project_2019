cACGMM notes:

- gives a time-frequancy mask for source seperation
- models the data distribution better then previus algorithems
- source seperationn based on masks. What are the other available methods?
- directional statistics
- Expectation Maximization problem - What it is?
- How is the algorithem used for source seperation?
- what is watson distribution?
- what is maximum liklihood estimation method?
- permutation problem - sience for each (f,t) bin the values are estimated independently, then we need to make sure that the same k is the same signal every time
- what is complex Angular Central Gaussian distribution?
- Swada's method for solving the permutation problem
