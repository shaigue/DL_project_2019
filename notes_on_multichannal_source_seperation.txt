- doing learining on the frequancy domain
- multi channels filters
- Gaussian model - how it is used to exploit spetial information?
- iterative expectation maximization(EM) - what is this?
- wiener filter - what is this?
- when searching for an algorithem implementation, search github with keywords
- short time furier transform
- multivariate complex-valued zero-mean Gaussian distribution
- power spectral density(PSD) ?
- spatial covariance matrices ?
- spatial source images?
- spectogram fitting 
- spectral models?
- spectral parameters model [down]
- NMF, KAM
### important:
- *** figure out equations 1.6,1.7,1.8
- *** figure out algorithem 1
- *** figure out section 1.3.3
###
- figure out how to model spectrogram initialization, and spectrogram fitting
- how the model is relating to the PSD, and what exactly are the z_x and z_i 
- more spectrogram initialization, less updating of spectral , more spetial components
- how do you obtain the target v_j tilda?
- whats JFN in the cost functions?
- Algorithem 2 in the paper is actually the forward pass, recieving the input spectrogram and transforming ito seperate sources
- What is DS beamforming, and how does it minimizes complex-values stfs?
